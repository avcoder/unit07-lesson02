# Using Joins

```sql
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);

-- INNER JOIN
SELECT Students.FirstName, Courses.CourseName
FROM Enrollments
JOIN Students ON Enrollments.StudentID = Students.StudentID
JOIN Courses ON Enrollments.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;
```

## Exercises
1. Create a table Projects and EmployeeProjects (mapping employees to projects). Use a JOIN to list employee names and their project names.
